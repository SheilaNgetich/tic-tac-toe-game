# 💖 Tic-Tac-Toe Game 💜

Welcome to the **Tic-Tac-Toe** game! This is a classic game where **Player 1** and **Player 2** take turns placing **X** and **O** on a grid, aiming to get three in a row. 🕹️✨

## 💡 Description

The **Tic-Tac-Toe** game is a **Java Swing-based** desktop application that allows two players to play the game on a 3x3 grid. Each player can place their mark (X or O) on an empty cell, and the game checks for a winner after every move.

Whether you're having a quick break or challenging a friend, this game provides a **fun**, **interactive**, and **user-friendly** experience.

With its **simple layout**, this game can be enjoyed by everyone, regardless of age or technical expertise. The game tracks turns, prevents players from choosing already-filled cells, and notifies the winner with a popup message.

### The app features:
- **Turn-based gameplay** where Player 1 uses **X** and Player 2 uses **O**.
- **Win detection** that checks if a player has achieved three in a row.
- A **reset button** to restart the game after each round.
- **Dynamic feedback** for invalid moves (e.g., trying to fill a cell that’s already occupied).

## 🚀 Features
- **Two-player turn-based gameplay** on a 3x3 grid.
- **Player 1 (X)** and **Player 2 (O)** take alternating turns.
- **Win detection** that pops up a congratulatory message when a player wins.
- **Reset button** to start a new game after a round ends.
- **Invalid move handling** to avoid filling a cell that's already taken.
